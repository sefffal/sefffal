            <h1>Observational Work</h1>
            <p>
                One of my largest observational projects to date has been the Deep orbital Search for Additoinal Planets in the HR8799 system (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aca1af">Thompson et al, 2022</a>). The image below combines four quarter-nights of Keck NIRC2 data to display the four known planets in the HR8799 system (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09684">Marois et al, 2010</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                These four planets are the first directly imaged planetary massed objects outside our solar system, and have been extensively studied.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work on this system included observering and gathering 16 nights of NIRC2 observations, developing new ADI post-processing techniques (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/abee7d/pdf">Thompson &amp; Marois, 2021</a>) and developing new orbit modelling techniques to search for faint companions in the presence of orbital motion.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project led to the detection of a candidate fifth inner planet: a possible explanation for proper motion measurements that are in tension with atmosphere models.
                The orbital constraints from this program are also unique in that they come entirely from Keck L band images, an insturment that has exceptionally well-calibrated astrometry. Other instruments like GRAVITY can far exceed the precision of these measurements, but can't yet match the long time baseline.
            </p>

            <p>Below is one of the highest SNR images recorded of the four confirmed planets:</p>
            <img src="../images/hr8799-crop-web.png" width="250" />
            <p>And here is that same image, with orbits of the four confirmed and fifth candidate planet (with orbits derived exclusively from Keck images in this program):</p>

            <p>
                I also used data from this project to create the first 100% uniformly reduced orbital animation of the system, see here:

            This animation uses a keplerian motion interpolation scheme to smoothly move between images.
